            "The Greeks regarded the act of discovering fire with very split
            emotions. On the one hand, fire was for them as for us a great
            benefit to all humanity. On the other, the carrying down of fire
            from heaven to earth was a defiance of the Gods of Olympus, and
            could not but be punished by them as a piece of insolence towards
            their prerogatives, thus we see the great figure of Prometheus, the
            fire-bearer, the prototype of the scientist; a hero but a hero
            damned, chained on the Caucasus with vultures gnawing at his liver."

            magic. Know-how vs know-what. These vultures aren’t picking on the
            liver of Prometheus. This creature isn’t chasing Frankenstein. The
            punishment is falling on us all, but mostly on the less privileged
            and most vulnerable.

            But “rule-bending” in this sense is part of human nature, part of
            how we define consciousness and distinguish human from animal. This
            ambition to make existence easier is probably the survival tactic
            that made humanity thrive. By inventing technology to remove
            obstacles (machine = remedy), we divert our efforts to other areas.
            Technology as an integral part of being human.
