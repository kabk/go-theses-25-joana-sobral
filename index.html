          The werewolf: a howl under the full moon, teeth, claws, and fur. A
          secret uncontrollable rage, a wolf among sheep, a danger to the
          community. The transformation between a wild animal and its civilized
          form, dividing human nature into what’s acceptable and what’s not. How
          do you tame the big bad wolf?
        </p>
        <p>
          The machine: an object. Easy, quick, effective, a perfect result every
          time. The mark of an advanced civilization, to free mankind of labor.
          Powerful servants of the masses, controlled by an elite few. Who do
          these machines actually serve?
        </p>
        <p>
          The mythology of the werewolf and the ideological development of
          automatization technologies: by analyzing these two starting points as
          manifestations of the desire to tame human nature, this text will
          frame machines as anti-animalizing tools. It will investigate the
          overpowering machinic qualities of civilization, and how they result
          in societal development being aimed at fellow machines rather than
          real people. Finally, it will reflect on the inevitability of the
          animal qualities of human nature, and their ability to adapt to the
          imposing smoothness of digital technologies. This research will be
          conducted by analyzing historical documentation and case studies
          relating to either topic and analyzing the intersections of their
          respective discourses.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="under_sectiontitle_space"></div>
        <p>
          I often refer to my laptop as “she”. Not only because I think it adds
          a touch of wit and whimsy to any sentence, but also because it somehow
          makes sense: she’s a girl, just like me.
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          She helps me in my work and shows me cool movies, and is by my side
          when I need her with (almost) no complaints. She has enough data on me
          to make somewhat accurate predictions on which album I might want to
          play next, or which website I’ll visit, or even which of my contacts
          I’ll call at the end of the day. But I know her pretty well too. I can
          recognize how her movements change when she’s getting tired, I know
          how to adapt my language when she gives me more advertisements than
          actual information, and I don’t actually need a website to be
          well-constructed to find what I’m looking for. I recognize that this
          fluency goes beyond my own personal device, and that it’s a level of
          digital literacy I’ve gained from years of experience. Comparing this
          relationship with the way some members of my family treat and speak
          about their devices, they seem to experience much more frustration and
          confusion, and I see they haven’t developed as much sensitivity for
          understanding their device. But if machines are made to be used by us,
          if they’re so intelligent and intuitive and practical, why are they
          indecipherable for some? How has this dynamic of two-way communication
          become such an important part of working with machines?
        </p>
        <p>
          These questions lead me into investigating the human-machine
          relationship, the duality between people and their faster and more
          efficient counterparts. In the context of work and production,
          machines seem to be an embodiment of the better parts of human nature:
          a stoic entity that tirelessly does whatever it’s told, instead of a
          needy and less engineerable employee. In a culture that deems
          production as a necessity to participate in society, the machine has a
          more secure place within our civilization than the human. But how
          civilized can a system be when it serves primarily machines rather
          than people?
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time I started thinking about a lecture I attended about
          werewolves, by designer and theorist Lluís Sallés.
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          In it, he outlined the development of the werewolf myth and how it
          represents how we might deal with “otherness”. For not fitting the
          pattern of what we consider civilized, we might conceptualize the
          other as a monster. As people, we might even conceptualize our own
          “unproductive” characteristics as monstrous. Drawing parallels between
          the dualities of man-wolf and man-machine, where an unpredictable side
          seems to “drag down” a comparatively more functional side, I started
          wondering how researching the myth of the werewolf might answer my
          questions about machines.

          When I mention werewolves, you probably imagine a scene very similar
          to this description. Although it was written two thousand and
          seventeen years ago,
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          In <span class="body_italics">Metamorphoses</span>, Ovid’s epic on
          classic Greco-Roman mythology, there is one of the first mentions of a
          man-wolf shapeshifter in human history: the myth of Lykaon. The story
          goes that Lykaon, the tyrant ruler of the land of Arcadia, decided to
          test the Olympian gods by trying to feed Zeus human meat.
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          He killed his own son and cooked him, but Zeus caught on to the trick.
          Furious, he cursed Lykaon by turning him into a wolf with an
          insatiable thirst for human blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cleric / Occult researcher
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          Montague Summers defines a werewolf as
          <span class="body_italics"
            >“a human being, man, woman or child (more often the first), who
            either voluntarily or involuntarily changes or is metamorphosed into
            the apparent shape of a wolf, and who is then possessed of all the
            characteristics, the foul appetites, ferocity, cunning, the brute
            strength, and swiftness of that animal.”</span
          >
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          Nowadays we might see the werewolf as a made-up creature from
          blurry-rooted tales that has since found a home in Hollywood and
          fantasy. However, throughout centuries there have been documented
          real-life werewolves, also known as lycanthropes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The term lycanthropy (as you might’ve guessed, originating from
          Lykaon) refers to the psychological and/or supernatural condition of
          being able to transform into a wolf.
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          Cases of lycanthropy span over centuries but peaked at the same time
          as witch-hunting in Europe. We now treat it as a psychological
          disorder, where the afflicted person genuinely believes they possess
          the physical capabilities of or can transform into a wolf. Cases of
          lycanthropy usually include serial murder and cannibalism; the most
          recent instance was reported in 2019.
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most famous and horrifying trials of a lycanthrope was of
          Peter Stubbe/Stumpp,
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          also known as the werewolf of Bedburg.
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          He was a wealthy farmer and father of two from a rural community in
          sixteenth century Germany, who confessed to having made a deal with
          the devil for a belt which granted him the power to transform into
          <span class="body_italics"
            >“a greedy, devouring wolf, strong and mighty, with eyes great and
            large… a mouth great and wide, with most sharp and cruel teeth, a
            huge body and mighty paws.”</span
          >
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          Allegedly, Stubbe killed and ate two pregnant women and fourteen
          children, one of which his own son. He was also accused of rape and
          incest of multiple people including his daughter, as well as
          bestiality and devouring many animals. Once caught in 1589, he was
          punished by being horrendously tortured, beheaded, and burned at the
          stake along with his mistress and his daughter. Warding off similar
          behaviour, local authorities erected a pole with the torture wheel
          used in the trial, topped with a figure of a wolf and Stubbe’s head.
          The following image documents his trial procedure.<br />
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
        </p>
        <div class="background_image_section" id="Stumpp"></div>
        <p>
          Before the development of psychiatry and a somewhat general disbelief
          in the supernatural, communities in Western Europe tended to look to
          religion and spirituality to explain what might bring someone to such
          gruesome actions. To give some context on the religious ideology at
          the time, in order to absolve someone of their sins, a priest had to
          decide if the sinful action meant that the offender had placed any
          other powers at the same height (or above) the powers of God.
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          This divisive and combative duality between an absolute good and an
          absolute evil is known as Manichaeism. Through this ideology, a
          culture of “you’re either with me or against me” emerged, by which
          violence against any otherness was justified. This dynamic only
          strengthened as different sects of Christianity spread among
          populations of Western Europe. This “threatened” the Catholic Church
          and lead it to deem these sects as Satanic, accusing them of spreading
          false and dangerous morals.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, it’s important to understand that in Western Europe
          the animal that posed the greatest threat to mankind was the wolf.
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          Nowadays, after centuries of developing urban landscapes which attempt
          to keep wilderness at bay, we cannot comprehend the fear that the wolf
          instilled in communities at the time. Inhabiting the remote and
          untamed depths of the dark forests surrounding human settlements,
          regardless of the continuous human efforts to hunt and kill it, the
          wolf persisted for centuries, making it the perfect form for Western
          European fears to shapeshift into.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon enough, the story of the werewolf wasn’t necessarily about serial
          murders anymore. By the 16th century, following Catholic values at a
          time of religious turmoil in Europe, the werewolf became more of a
          cautionary tale about the dangers of not repressing the “wild”,
          separating human nature into two sides: civilized versus uncivilized.
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          The morale of this story was that it’s dangerous not to repress our
          supposedly untame characteristics, demonizing those who fail to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          As weary as I am of quoting Freud, he wrote about this same dynamic
          from a sociologist perspective in arguing that to be civilized means
          to repress yourself to some extent:
          <span class="body_italics"
            >“Communal life becomes possible only when a majority comes together
            that is stronger than any individual and presents a united front
            against every individual. The power of the community then pits
            itself, in the name of ‘right’, against the power of the individual,
            which is condemned as ‘brute force’.”</span
          >
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          In a utilitarian and egalitarian society, where all individuals are
          equal and strive for the good of the group, the will of the majority
          wins over the will of a few. Here, the idea of Manichaeism returns,
          where there is one motion that represents a net positive for the
          community and another which represents a net negative.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <span class="body_italics">Spirit and Teeth</span>, by another
          author I’m weary of quoting, Nick Land explains this concept by
          pointing out how in the right hands, fire is
          <span class="body_italics"
            >“the hearth, the protective and nutrifying glow,”</span
          >
          an analogy for ingenuity and progress, but when handled by the other
          side, it is a
          <span class="body_italics"
            >“dissolvant blaze which spreads uncontrollably, (…) the fire of
            waste, dissipation, dehumanization.”</span
          >
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          We don’t want to entrust agency to the members of civilization we deem
          as uncivilized, because their very nature suggests this would destroy
          the structures we call progress. Therefore, it’s safer to outcast
          these outsiders, excluding them from the past, future, and present of
          the societies they inhabit.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
          “To be a werewolf is to be inferior by the most basic criteria of
          civilization. Not only is the discipline of political responsibility
          alien to them, so is the entire history of work in which such
          discipline is embedded. (…) The accursed race, living like beasts,
          whose veins are inflamed by a cosmic menstruation, have never entered
          into the great project of civilization, which begins with the use of
          fire to keep the wild animals at bay.”
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          This interpretation of the werewolf creates a cycle, generating a
          self-sustaining system of separation between the werewolf and
          civilization:
        </p>
        <p>
          Inability to repress wilderness is demonized.<br />Repression is a
          characteristic of civilization.<br />Wilderness is seen as
          destructive.<br />Wilderness is excluded from society.

        <p>
          Are you still thinking about Peter Stubbe from the last chapter? Part
          of me wants to defend the wilderness of the werewolf for being an
          outcast of society, but this feeling starts to shrivels up when I
          think of him. Even understanding that it’s a true story, I tend to
          read it as fiction for how it reminds me of the killer psychopath
          trope from the horror genre: the unpredictable violent criminal
          possessed by a demon or a horrible condition, imprisoned to solitary
          confinement inside a straightjacket. Of course we want to keep this
          dangerous type of otherness away. It’s like finding some really old
          yoghurt in the back of your fridge: an instinctive feeling of disgust
          and abject takes over, making you forget about recycling the packaging
          as you deal with it under five layers of gloves. You can’t even stand
          to look at it.
        </p>
        <p>
          How is it possible that the human species, who evolved into developing
          altruism, empathy, and compassion, who repeatedly demonstrates a
          calling to create art and science and philosophy, is also capable of
          murder, of genocide? This text will not attempt to answer this age-old
          question. It will, however, point out that as people we’ve always
          struggled to cope with our own duality.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we’re confronted with hideousness within ourselves, with
          something we’re not quite able to accept, a similar feeling to that of
          the old yoghurt takes over. In order to keep the safety of our
          societies, we feel that we must throw out the disgusting animal. The
          concept of civilization itself suggests leaving behind animal
          wilderness and advancing into a more developed and cultured way of
          living, by building technologies such as tools, walls, laws, etc. By
          progressively making our existence easier and more comfortable, we’ve
          continued to create distance between our human experiences and nature
          in its wild, untouched state.

          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          In other words, we melt a rough wild world and pour it into molds we
          construct; we attempt to build perfectly smooth construction blocks
          that fit better together according to our convenience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this understanding of ourselves and of the world as
          optimizable, we engineer ways of calculating each individual, process,
          and resource. Having this data lets us create control strategies which
          (theoretically) remove the dangers of unpredictability and animalism.
          For example, we’ve invented ophthalmology to fix eyesight to a
          standard, we’ve invented a pill that helps control the frequency of
          pregnancies, and we’re cloning meat in labs to create alternative food
          sources. By translating the world into numbers we’re able to track, we
          invent systems to figure out how to organize ourselves and make
          machines that maximize productivity. And in theory this is great
          because again, by removing wilderness from our societies and allowing
          us to plan for how to get the most out of our resources, we promote
          our own survival, comfort, and prosperity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through these logics that equate systems with righteousness, we create
          power dynamics that favour productivity and the machinic spirit that
          supports it. We create the idea that our civilization should function
          like a well-oiled machine, a complicated mechanism made up of very
          specific parts, and that would come to a halt if some of these parts
          were “misshapen”. This dynamic echoes the rhetoric of the werewolf. By
          requiring smoothness of its participants, the system punishes any
          roughness in individuals that challenge machinic functioning:
          unpredictability, wilderness, the wolf.

          <span class="body_italics">Heyyyy,</span> so, we’re 2531 words in and
          I’m about to tell you about some weird AI stuff I’ve seen, but first
          let me actually introduce myself. My name is Joana, and with this text
          I’m hoping to finish my degree in Graphic Design. As a young woman
          planning on making a living as a creative/developer during a global
          recession, I can’t say I’m not afraid of the future of AI, and
          recognize my bias against it. But I want to clarify that by discussing
          this technology in relation to the werewolf, my aim is not to demonize
          it. I don’t blame anyone who (responsibly) uses this technology to
          save time, money, or energy, and appreciate the innovation it has
          brought to several fields, including the creative one. Although I
          avoid using it for personal creative and environmental reasons, I also
          try to keep an open mind to how it can continue to make itself part of
          the world in helpful ways.

        <p>
          Now that we’re a little more cozy, let’s move on. In late November
          2024, Telephone Communication Limited (TCL, the largest television
          manufacturer worldwide) held a panel talk and screening of the first
          AI-generated films at the Chinese Theater in Hollywood.
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          These short films are available online, watch at your own risk. The
          images below are stills from (in my opinion) the most
          disturbing-looking one out of the total five released. It’s a
          body-horror short film about a woman who due to an unexplained illness
          turns into a giant slug:<br />
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
        </p>
        <div class="background_image_section" id="slug"></div>
        <p>
          As explained at the event by the general manager of TCL Research
          America, Haohong Wang, the aim of the project is to
          <span class="body_italics"
            >“create a flywheel effect funded by two forces, advertising and
            AI,”</span
          >
          creating a content-producing strategy that is both funded and informed
          by targeted advertising.
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          As was later explained by TCL’s vice president of content service and
          partnerships, Catherine Zhang:
          <span class="body_italics"
            >“data told us that our users don’t want to work that hard, half of
            them don’t even change the channel.”</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          In his article on the event, Jason Koebler from 404 Media goes on to
          discuss the implications of AI on the creative and economical lives of
          creators:
          <span class="body_italics"
            >“I can’t say for sure why any of the directors or individual people
            working on these films decided to work on AI movies, whether they
            are actually excited by the prospects here or whether they simply
            needed work in an industry and town that is currently struggling
            following a writers strike that was partially about having AI
            foisted upon them.”</span
          >
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I want to zoom into the utility of these short films.
          Regardless of any potential artistic intention of the few humans
          involved in their making, as Wang explained, more than anything they
          were created to generate profit as quickly and effortlessly as
          possible. Therefore, they are marketable digital content before they
          are art.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the last couple years there has been a very tangible shift of the
          internet as a place for personal interconnectedness to a place for
          generating profit, accelerated by the spreading accessibility of AI
          tools. Another example is the shifting purpose of YouTube, a digital
          platform started in 2005 for anyone to share personal videos,
          encouraging many to experiment with the medium as a form of personal
          expression.
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          Later came the implementation of advertisements, leading to the
          “YouTuber” and influencer profession as a potential way for anyone to
          earn from the platform, possibly even to make a living. Now, in the
          last couple years, a new side-hustle trend has been saturating the
          platform with automated channels, run by using AI tools to script,
          write, voice, and edit videos.
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          As opposed to a “regular” side-job, this option offers the opportunity
          to earn an extra income without spending as much time and energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          But hey, what else are we supposed to do during a global recession,
          when so many people aren’t able to make a livable wage? These two
          examples are of course very different scenarios: one is a company that
          made 24.3B$ in revenue in 2024 that’s trying to make even more money,
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          the other is a mass of anonymous individuals trying to make more out
          of what they have. Regardless, both are products and upholders of the
          societal and economical dynamics we’ve created. Again, as explained in
          the previous chapter, we idealize optimization and production to the
          point that as individuals, in order to ensure our own survival, we're
          pushed to melt and pour ourselves into molds that fit into these
          machinic dynamics. Through this process, wild and animalistic human
          processes like self-expressive creativity are sacrificed, in order to
          make profitable products instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enter cybernetics, a field of mathematics and science pioneered by
          Norbert Wiener around the 1950’s, who defined it as
          <span class="body_italics"
            >“the science of control and communications in the animal and
            machine.”</span
          >
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          In essence, it studies how a total of interconnected pieces function
          together to maintain the whole and create progress, equating the
          functioning of an animal to that of a machine. Living beings are made
          up of cells and tissues and organs that work together to keep them
          alive. Machines are made up of sensors and decision-making mechanisms
          and executers that work together to keep them functioning.
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Extending this logic further, cybernetics allows us to once again
          arrive at the point that our societies function as large machines made
          up of interconnected individuals, working together to maintain
          themselves and create progress. Wiener argued that as members of
          society, we are virtually equivalent to machines:
          <span class="body_italics"
            >“What is used as an element in a machine, is in fact an element in
            the machine. Whether we entrust our decisions to machines of metal,
            or to those machines of flesh and blood which are bureaus and vast
            laboratories and armies and corporations, we shall never receive the
            right answers to our questions unless we ask the right
            questions.”</span
          >
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          In other words, since mechanical functioning requires its parts to
          work smoothly and predictably, being participants of a machinic
          society means that we as people become machines to an extent.
          Therefore, it doesn’t matter much anymore whether a decision is made
          by an actual human participant or a mechanical component of this
          machine. From this, Wiener argues that it’s much more relevant to
          question the whole system under which such decisions are made.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this cybernetic envisioning of our societies, we see that in
          reality we’ve shaped them to accommodate machines rather than actual
          people. By scaring away the animal to protect the productivity of
          smoothness, we’ve created systems that reward machinic behaviour.
          We’ve come to value the characteristics of human nature which align
          better with the functioning of machines, while suppressing those that
          are more animalistic. As in the examples from this chapter, human
          creativity is better rewarded when used to make something profitable
          and productive, feeding the machine, than when it is used for
          self-expression. Those that are able to adapt and evolve into
          functioning more mechanically are able to survive, maintaining and
          developing the machine further.
        </p>
        <p>
          Machinic functioning is an extension of human nature, of our desire
          for prosperity and inclination to building systems in the name of
          survival. However, we will never be as productive and smooth as our
          architectures ask of us. Because at the end of the day, we are just
          living, breathing, flowing, evolving, unique, wild animals.

        <h2>The Machine Under the Full Moon</h2>
        <div class="under_sectiontitle_space"></div>
        <p>
          The original story of the werewolf, the myth of Lykaon’s curse,
          doesn’t mention the moon as an ingredient of the werewolf’s
          transformation. The connection between the werewolf and the moon
          actually comes from medieval France.
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          In populations near the dark forests of the Burgundy region, people
          believed they could be cursed to become
          <span class="body_italics">loup-garous</span>: ordinary people that
          transform into blood-thirsty wolves under the light of the full moon.
          Sharing the same narrative as the other branches of the tale, the
          belief was that this curse was a punishment for not following the
          teachings of the church.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moon: a symbol of change, of cyclical transformation. In his
          article into the interpretation of the myth of the werewolf, Eddie
          Ejjbair points out how
          <span class="body_italics"
            >“the historical attribution of lycanthropy to man is interesting
            considering the well-established link between femininity and the
            lunar cycle.”</span
          >
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          There’s the obvious connection between menstruation and the werewolf,
          of experiencing a monthly bloody outburst of rage and wilderness. An
          experience that seems destructive against the more predictable (and
          machinic) daily energetic rhythm of the male hormonal cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond this connection, in her meta-analysis of werewolf tropes in
          horror media, Gwen C Katz discusses how through the genre, several
          artists have explored the conceptual connection between the werewolf
          and other “violent” natural physical experiences, namely feminine
          ones.
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          For example, how Catherine Lundoff’s
          <span class="body_italics">Silver Moon</span> explores the werewolf as
          a metaphor for menopause, or how werewolf-hood in John Fawcett’s
          <span class="body_italics">Ginger Snaps</span> represents feminine
          puberty. In both stories the wolf is an analogy for an abrupt change
          to the body, challenging because of how the character must “act
          normal” in a new condition which doesn’t fit with societal
          expectations. However, these transformations also present the
          characters with a new sense of freedom and power. In
          <span class="body_italics">Silver Moon</span>, Becca’s transformation
          grants her the possibility of creating a new path after divorcing her
          ex-husband, as well as exploring her same-sex attraction. In
          <span class="body_italics">Ginger Snaps</span>, Ginger’s
          transformation represents her growing into an adolescent, adapting to
          a more powerful body and experiencing sexual desire.

          Katz uses the term
          <span class="body_italics">hopeful monster</span> to describe this
          duality of monstrousness and freedom in the werewolf trope. She argues
          that this duality gives the myth the ability to explore the abhorrent
          with a certain open-mindedness, making the viewer question their fear
          of animalistic instincts in the first place. However, the same term is
          used in the field of evolutionary biology to refer to
          <span class="body_italics"
            >“organisms with a profound mutant phenotype that have the potential

        <p>
          Regardless of how they exist in very different contexts, both
          definitions speak to the creative spirit of the werewolf, describing
          its outcastedness as its strength, much like the terrifying unkillable
          wolf of the Middle Ages. As explained in the first chapter, excluding
          wilderness from society means the werewolf doesn’t have the safety of
          being rooted in an ideology or history that represents them, like
          their civilized counterparts. Removed from a cybernetic society built
          of coding languages, excused of the cyborg vision of optimizing
          material reality, this is all the werewolf has left: raw reality. By
          representing our tie to nature, the only human characteristic we
          simply can't melt down (as long as we’re still biologically living
          beings), the wolf gains its immortality. Although unable to enjoy the
          successes and disasters of a machine society, the spirit of the
          werewolf prevails.

          Despite of how sophisticated a machine might be, the full moon always
          returns to disrupt its supposed smoothness. Regardless of the pressure
          exerted by the machinic patterns we’ve created, the urge to shapeshift
          will always be louder, as exemplified by the phenomenon of folk
          programming. Spencer Chang defines it as
          <span class="body_italics"
            >“the kind of (re)programming we learn through our active use of the
            Internet and software. As we use the Internet and learn how it
            works, we’re constantly changing software to work for us (and in
            doing so, make it feel more like us, too). If you’ve ever used an
            app outside of its intended purpose, you are a folk
            programmer.”</span

        <p>
          I’ll leave you with one of my favourite examples of this concept. On
          May 2nd in 2020, Marie Foulston organized a party on a Google Sheets
          document.
          <span class="intext_footnote">✷</span>
          In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, she missed certain unspoken
          rituals of social interaction, the subtle elements that go beyond the
          exhaustingly literal translation of a conversation through video call.
          In the format of Google Sheets, someone’s presence is only known
          through their clicking on a cell, adding text or images or color.
          Conversations flow beyond time, as it’d been impossible to tell if the
          text written on any particular cell had been written 10 seconds or 10
          minutes ago, by a close friend or someone you’d never met.
          Nevertheless, guests would hang out in the Kitchen sheet, dance and
          take mysterious gummies on the dance-floor, quietly sit together and
          chat while enjoying a virtual sunrise.

          Our creativity in problem solving allows us to find countless
          alternative ways to interact with any object or tool. Just as we might
          think to use a chair to reach a high shelf, we might think of using an
          online data processing program to host a virtual house party.
          Similarly, regardless of the rigidness of the systems we might put in
          place and adapt ourselves to, our werewolf nature dictates that
          shapeshifting is inevitable, as we’ll always find room to transform.
          The concept of folk programming re-centers the real human in digital
          technologies, subverting the societal power of the machine.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <div class="under_sectiontitle_space"></div>
        <p>
          Hi again, this is it, we did it, we’ve made it to the end. Together,
          we’ve travelled a long and winding path through the entangled forest
          that this text inhabits. So use this conclusion to rest and recollect
          the main ideas we’ve covered.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want one of your main takeaways to be that you are a very smart
          animal. Our intelligence and desire to survive and prosper have driven
          us to organize ourselves according to systems that prioritize safety
          and productivity, requiring us to distance ourselves from the
          unpredictability of animal nature. In other words, we’ve built
          societies that encourage the machinic qualities of human nature, while
          suppressing the animalistic ones. This is the ideology behind the
          werewolf: a tale that’s supposed to teach us that it’s dangerous not
          to suppress our wilderness.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this process of de-animalizing ourselves, we’ve developed
          civilizations that run on and maintain this expectation of tameness
          and smoothness. Therefore, these machinic societies end up
          accommodating other machines better than actual people. As digital
          technologies develop in what seems like a never-ending race, their use
          is no longer necessarily to add to human experiences, but to produce
          more with less, to contribute further to the societal machine. The
          intended user is no longer an actual person, but a fellow machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, just as the werewolf transforms with the loyal and eternal
          lunar cycle, our human nature always finds the space to shapeshift.
          The myth of the werewolf teaches us that our animalness–our
          rebelliousness, creativity, non-conformity–threatens the systems we’ve
          built, but it also shows that this wilderness is inevitable,
          regardless of any technological pressure to domesticate it.
